## TV-regularized segmentation (test_tvsegment)

This example is about (multi-label) image segmentation, specifically about a convex relaxation of the Potts model. The problem to find a set of regions `R_1`, ..., `R_K` which form a partition of the image domain. This can be formulated as:

$$
\min_{R_1,\dots,R_K} \lambda \sum_{l=1}^K Per(R_l ; \Omega) + \sum_{l=1}^K \int_{R_l} f_l dx \text{ s.t. } R_i \cap R_j = \varnothing \forall i\neq j, \text{ and } \cup_{l=1}^K R_l = \Omega
$$

The first term penalizes the boundary length. The second term is some prior on region assignments.

A common convex relaxation of this problem is:

$$
\min_{u_1,\dots,u_K}\lambda \sum_{l=1}^K \int_{\Omega} |WDu_l| + \sum_{l=1}^K \int_{\Omega} u_l f_l dx \text{ s.t. } u_l(x)\geq 0 \text{ and }\sum_{l=1}^K u_l(x) = 1 \forall x \in \Omega
$$

where `u_1`,...,`u_K` are indicators of a particular region, which can be recovered as `R_i = {x: u_i(x) = 1}`. The first term is the weighted TV regularization (relaxation of boundary perimeters). The probability simplex constraint is the relaxation of the requirement that only one region must be "active" at a pixel.

__Unary term__: In the examples below, the unary term is the Euclidean distance between the image intensity at a pixel and a prototype image intensity `c_l` (obtained by kmeans) 
$
f_l(x) = \| I(x)-c_l \|^2
$

In practice one should use something more sophisticated, e.g. using local statistics.

__TV weighing__: The edges are weighed by image similarity as:
$
W(x,z) = \exp(-\frac{1}{2 \beta} \| I(x)-I(z)\|^2 )
$

This is customary. The parameter `beta` can be used to control weights' range. Also, as customary `beta` is pre-multiplied by the average intensity difference estimated over the entire image.

__Optimization__: The problem is solved using first-order primal-dual algorithm (see references). It is highly parallelizable, but the current implementation does not attempt to do that.

### Examples

A sample call:

    ./test_tvsegment --input=../images/valley.jpg --output=out.png -beta=20 -lambda=.1 -num_clusters=5

Output:

    kmeans: n pts: 307200, dim: 3, K: 5
    learned cluster centers:
    K = 0: 0.920650 0.967045 0.994683 
    K = 1: 0.295402 0.233376 0.184025 
    K = 2: 0.339771 0.576018 0.847665 
    K = 3: 0.604728 0.763595 0.941981 
    K = 4: 0.460750 0.397112 0.335889 
    lambda: 0.100000
    beta: 20.000000
    num-clusters: 5
    isotropic: 1
    max-iters: 100
    image size: 480x640x3
    TV segmentation took: 5325.771973 ms
    Wrote the result to 'out.png'

Below are results for segmentation with varying number of clusters, and varying TV regularization penalty.
